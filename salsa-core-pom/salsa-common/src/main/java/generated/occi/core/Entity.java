/**
 * The root type for all resources as described in the OCCI Core Model.
 * <p/>
 * The <code>Entity</code> class represents the root type in the OCCI Core
 * Model type system. All OCCI-compliant resources are derived from this class.
 * It exposes mechanisms for managing an OCCI resource with respect to its
 * fundamental attributes, ({@link #id} and {@link #title}, and provides
 * facilities for managing a resource's mixins.
 * <p/>
 * This <code>Entity</code> exposes methods for the generic management of more
 * specific OCCI resource sub-types, including
 * <ul>
 * <li>attachment and detachment of mixins</li>
 * <li>retrieval and manipulation of attributes, and</li>
 * <li>invocation of actions.</li>
 * </ul>
 * In addition, it ensures the correct attribution in the OCCI term/scheme
 * model.
