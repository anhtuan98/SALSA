<h4>Create new collector for data retrieving</h4>
An adaptor is an .jar package that is plugged in to the collector to query data. Followings are some guidelines and notations to create this:
<ol>
<li> Create a normal Java project, then a class which extends <a href="https://github.com/tuwiendsg/SALSA/blob/master/elise-pom/elise-extensions/CollectorInterfaces/src/main/java/at/ac/tuwien/dsg/cloud/elise/collectorinterfaces/UnitInstanceCollector.java">the UnitInstanceCollector interface</a>. The class should implement:
  <ul>
            <li>The mechanism to collect the information</li>
            <li>The mechanism to identify the instance.</li>
        </ul>
</li>
<li> The application-specific information must be marshalled into string-based format (e.g. JSON, XML) in order to store in the UnitInstance object.
<li> Developer can reuse the function "readAdaptorConfig(String parameter)" to read the value in adaptor.conf going with the adaptor.
<li> SALSA will merge the collected information with existed instances in the database, thus the identification must enable SALSA to link with existed information.
</ol>

The artifact of the adaptor will be plugged in the collector as <a href"#populate_collector">the previous guide</a>.
