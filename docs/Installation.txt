The steps to setup SALSA are:
1. SALSA is packed as web application, running well on Tomcat server or standalone version with embedded Tomcat. There are two components:
 - The salsa engine: salsa-engine.war (with Tomcat) or salsa-engine.jar (standalone)
 - The salsa pioneer: salsa-pioneer.jar
2. Configure the salsa-engine parameters in file salsa.engine.properties and put in the same folder with the salsa-engine.jar or in /etc/
3. The salsa-pioneer.jar need to be put in the same folder with salsa-engine.[war/jar], or upload to a public repository and configured in step 2.
4. Deploy salsa-engine.war to the Tomcat or run the standalone version with port:
   $ java -jar --httpPort <portNumber> salsa-engine.jar
We also provide a service pattern to run the salsa-engine. Copy the salsa-engine-service script to /etc/init.d and run by:
   $ sudo service salsa-engine-service start/stop/restart/status
6. Access to the salsa-engine application to get the UI at: http://<IP of the machine>:<port>/salsa-engine
7. Using RESTful API at http://<IP of the machine>:<port>/salsa-engine/rest
