The steps to setup SALSA are:
1. Prepare a machine with OS installed. The VM must have Tomcat and apache2 ready.
2. Configure salsa-center-service and salsa-engine. The configuration files are in src/resources of each project.
3. Deploy salsa-service-center.war and salsa-engine.war to the Tomcat
4. Access to the salsa-engine application to get the UI.
