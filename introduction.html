<p class="justify">The blending of IoT and cloud technologies are emerging as a top research and development trend. IoT Cloud Systems are constructed by different types of devices, services and systems, which are deployed on multiple IoT and Cloud infrastructure. To managing these system, we need to perform various types of configuration such as provisioning infrastructures, configuring software layer, orchestrating the configuration, wiring application components, and reconfiguring dynamically the system at runtime. To reduce the effort of complex configuration management and provide fine-grained configuration features, we develop SALSA, a framework aming to automatic features for configuring IoT Cloud Systems on IoT and multi-cloud infrastructure.</p>

<u>Features:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Configure by multiple stacks: e.g. infrastructure, container/middleware, application, IoT unit.
  <li>Configure by multiple abstraction levels: e.g instance, instance-type, topology, whole system.
  <li>Configure by multiple phases: e.g. deployment time and runtime.
  <li>Configure on multiple clouds: applications can run on both private and public cloud.
  <li>Configure with rich capabilities: SALSA's default capabilities and external capabilities.
  <li>Ensure configuration dependencies: wire the configurations, maintain the component lifecycle.
</ul>

<u>Usability and performance:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Perform the configuration by distributed and independent agents.
  <li>Collect more capabilities dynamically when external services involve.
  <li>Manage the whole systems and all agents centrally via RESTful API and commandline client.
  <li>Communicate via message queue: loose-couple management and error-tolerance.
</ul>

<u>Development:</u>
<ul>
  <li>Opensource
  <li>Pluggable design for extending the configuration mechanisms (e.g. orchestration algorithms, configuration qualities)
  <li>Pluggable design for extending the supported configuration (e.g. cloud systems, artifact types)
</ul>
