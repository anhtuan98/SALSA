{"name":"SALSA","tagline":"A Framework for Dynamic Orchestration and Configuration Application on Multi-cloud","body":"# Abstract\r\nCloud computing technologies have been intensively exploited in development and management of distributed applications. Applications are constructed by different types of software, is deployed on multiple cloud providers, which have various ways to configure, and can change dynamically at runtime. Due to this complexity, we need a solution to reduce the configuration efforts by automating the complex tasks and providing fine-grained configuration features. In this paper, we introduce the concept of \\textit{multi-level configuration}, a novel approach for the configuration of complex applications on multi-cloud. Our solution enables the fine-grained configuration at different abstraction levels and support the dynamic change of applications at runtime.\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\nSALSA is a framework that provide automatic features for configuring and orchestrating distributed applications on multi-cloud system. SALSA can be used by application providers and application controllers to manage the application at deployment time and at runtime. The framework enables the configuration on different levels of application structure and deployment stacks, which provide fine-grained or full view about the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
